# Real-Time Video Forgery Detection Using LSTM in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for real-time video forgery detection using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project demonstrates how to process video streams, extract features, and utilize a trained LSTM model for detecting forgeries in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time video processing
- Feature extraction from video frames
- LSTM-based classification for forgery detection
- Display of classification results on video frames

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required toolboxes installed in your MATLAB environment. You can check and install toolboxes using the following commands:

```matlab
